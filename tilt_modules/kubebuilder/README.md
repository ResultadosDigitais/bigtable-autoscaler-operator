# Kubebuilder

Authors: [Ellen KÃ¶rbes](https://github.com/ellenkorbes), [Dan Miller](https://github.com/jazzdan/)

Enable live-update for developing [Kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder) projects.

## Usage

To use this extension, create a new directory, import the extension into your Tiltfile, and call the `kubebuilder()` function. E.g.

``` python
load('ext://kubebuilder', 'kubebuilder') 
kubebuilder("domain.tilt.dev", "tiltgroup", "v1", "CustomKind") 
```

The arguments are domain, group, version, and kind for the operator to be created.

It is required that kubebuilder be installed in the system and present on PATH. If you don't have Kubebuilder installed, check out Kubebuilder's [Quick Start](https://book.kubebuilder.io/quick-start.html#installation) guide.

## In Depth

This extension automates live-update setup for CRD changes, controller code changes, and sample YAML changes.

### CRD Changes

Let's say I have a `CustomKind` CRD:

```
$ kubectl get CustomKind
NAME                AGE
customkind-sample   5m41s
```

I can change the CRD definition by adding the code below, which changes the columns printed on kubectl output:

```
// +kubebuilder:printcolumn:name="Foo",type=string,JSONPath=`.spec.foo`
```

And the output gets instantly updated:

```
$ kubectl get CustomKind 
NAME                FOO 
customkind-sample   bar
```

### Sample YAML Changes

Changes to files in the `./config/samples` files also get automatically updated. E.g. by changing the following in my sample YAML...

```
spec:
  # Add fields here
  foo: newvalue
```

I now get the following output:

```
$ kubectl get CustomKind 
NAME                FOO 
customkind-sample   newvalue
```

### Controller Code Changes

Lastly, any changes to controller code also update automatically. For example, by adding the following to `./controllers/customkind_controller.go`...

```
log := r.Log.WithValues("customkind", req.NamespacedName)
log.Info("CONTROLLER SAYS HELLO!")
```

Tilt's logs immediately update to display the following output:

```
[manager] 2020-11-30T14:47:31.550Z    INFO    controllers.CustomKind    CONTROLLER SAYS HELLO!    {"customkind": "default/customkind-sample"}
```

## Clean Up

To delete all Kubebuilder resources from your cluster, use Tilt's `tilt down` command.
